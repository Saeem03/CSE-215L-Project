# Meal Management System


It is one of my first built UI based desktop based application.
The application is a meal management system that is able to calculate monthly spending and deposites of the people living in an appartment. As it's seen most of the students living in dhaka, have to live in a rented house as there is no dormitory or hall system for enough students. Students shares their flat with other people from their or other education institutions. Therefore lots of calculation part comes here, and it's hard to maintain all records, share equal bills, etc. Our application is here to help them with reducing their calculation problem and storing records.
